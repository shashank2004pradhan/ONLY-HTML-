        <h1>My First Year Experience as an ECE Student</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm a second-year ECE student, and during my first year, I had the opportunity to explore a wide range of topics and skills:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Built robots and learned about electronics and engineering principles.</li>
            <li>Explored various tech stacks and programming languages.</li>
            <li>Gained proficiency in Excel for data analysis and visualization.</li>
            <li>Studied finance and economics to broaden my understanding of business concepts.</li>
            <li>Explored marketing and sales strategies to understand their importance in the tech industry.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These experiences have given me a well-rounded foundation and a passion for learning in both technical and business domains. I'm excited to continue my journey as an ECE student!</p>
